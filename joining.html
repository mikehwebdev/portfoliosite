                <h2>Information for applicants</h2>
                  <p class="section-text">We have reopened applications for FAC holders and inexperienced applicants.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">You are welcome to contact us to enquire on our current position. We may invite you to complete an application and we will review it, but cannot guarantee being able to offer membership to prospective new members.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">You do not need to have a Fire Arm Certificate (FAC) or a rifle to join us, and several of our members choose not to obtain either a FAC or a rifle. We will be able to loan you enough equipment to get started.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">Please note that we only shoot .22 Rimfire calibre firearms and do not have facilities to shoot airguns.
                </p>
                  <p class="section-text">We have a high proportion of members who are qualified Range Conducting Officers and we place a high priority on safety.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">
                    We regret that we are currently unable to accept applicants from anyone under the age of 21. This is due to restrictions from our insurer.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">If you are interested in joining us, please read the additional information aside.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">Please note that all the information provided to us is checked for accuracy. Providing inaccurate information will result in membership being declined.</p>
                  <h2>Additional Information</h2>
                  <p class="section-text">It is very important that we verify the sincerity of prospective members.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">To this end, we've created a questionnaire for you to complete and copies of the declarations that the Home Office requires you to sign if you want to become a member. The Home Office requires all members to make a declaration regarding criminal records. All rifle clubs should apply this process to prospective members.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">We must make you aware that we notify the local constabulary of your application, and will also advise them when you leave or fail to attend for more than 12 months.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">If your completed application forms are acceptable, we will invite you to meet us. If you decide to join you will be accepted and will serve a three month probationary period</p>
                  <p class="section-text">We shoot every Tuesday through out the year and the annual fee is currently £95.00 plus £1 a week range fee and any competition fees and ammunition.</p>
                  <p class="section-text">Please contact us if you wish to complete an application and we will email you the application forms. Please then return them to the email address on the forms.</p>
                  <p class="section-text"><strong>We are a small club with restricted facilities. In the event we are unable to offer membership we can point you to other clubs in the area who may have capacity to accommodate you.</strong>
