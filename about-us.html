                <p class="section-text">Currently the club takes part in postal competitions where individuals and teams compete against each other but from their home ranges. The rifles used are all .22 rimfire but range from historic pieces to modern devices with electronic triggers.</p>

                <p class="section-text">Over the years the club has had changing fortunes but has maintained a small but loyal membership. We are always pleased to hear from any ex members or their friends and families. We would like to be able to add to our archives with some anecdotes, pictures and mementos that will help us to maintain our history for the future.</p>
